### .NET Framework

**.NET Framework** is a development platform developed by Microsoft.
It is a software framework primarily designed for building and running applications on Windows.
It includes a large set of libraries, tools, and runtime components that support various programming languages such as C#, Visual Basic, and F#.
The .NET Framework has been widely used for Windows desktop applications, web applications, and services.

### .NET Standard

On the other hand, **.NET Standard** is a specification that defines a set of APIs that must be available on platforms implementing the standard.
It is designed to facilitate code sharing and compatibility across different .NET platforms, including .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin.
By targeting .NET Standard, developers can create libraries that can be used across multiple .NET implementations without modification.

### ksqlDB.RestApi.Client

In summary, .NET Framework is a specific implementation of the .NET platform that primarily targets Windows, while .NET Standard is a specification that defines a common set of APIs across different .NET implementations.

The `ksqlDB.RestApi.Client` library leverages .NET Standard to achieve cross-platform compatibility, maximize code reuse, benefit from the broader .NET ecosystem, and ensure compatibility with evolving platforms.
By targeting .NET Standard, the library can be used across different .NET implementations such as .NET Framework, providing developers with flexibility and efficiency in their application development process.
